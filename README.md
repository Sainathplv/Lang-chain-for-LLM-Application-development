# LangChain vs. OpenAI API
LangChain: A library that provides tools and frameworks for building conversational AI applications. It offers components for memory management, chains of operations, and evaluation, among others.
OpenAI API: An API provided by OpenAI that allows access to powerful language models like GPT-3. It's primarily used for generating text, translating languages, and answering questions.
LangChain can be used in conjunction with the OpenAI API to build more complex and interactive conversational AI systems. While the OpenAI API provides the core language model capabilities, LangChain offers additional tools and frameworks to manage conversations, evaluate performance, and integrate with other systems.

# Notebook 1: Model Prompt Parser
This notebook introduces the ModelPromptParser class, which is used to parse prompts for language models. It demonstrates how to set up the class and use it with an example language model.

# Notebook 2: Memory
The second notebook explores different memory management techniques for conversational AI:

ConversationBufferMemory: Stores the entire conversation history in memory. Useful for maintaining context in ongoing conversations.
ConversationBufferWindowMemory: Similar to ConversationBufferMemory but limits the stored conversation history to a specified window size (e.g., the last few exchanges). This helps manage memory usage while still keeping recent context.
ConversationTokenBufferMemory: Manages memory based on token limits instead of conversation exchanges. This is useful for language models with token limits, ensuring that the conversation fits within the model's constraints.
ConversationSummaryBufferMemory: Summarizes the conversation history instead of storing it verbatim. This can be useful for long conversations where only the gist is needed for context.
Each section provides examples of how to use these classes to manage conversation memory.

# Notebook 3: Chains
In this notebook, we learn about the Chain class and its variants like ConversationChain and ConditionalChain:

ConversationChain: Manages a conversation by chaining together different operations, such as memory management and response generation. This allows for more structured and coherent conversation flow.
ConditionalChain: Adds conditional logic to the chaining process. For example, it can apply different operations based on the content of the conversation or external factors.
The notebook shows how to create and apply chains for different operations, including conversation management and conditional processing.

# Notebook 4: QnA
The fourth notebook focuses on the QnA class for question and answer operations. It covers how to use hard-coded examples, generate examples with an LLM, combine examples, manually evaluate QnA performance, and use LLM-assisted evaluation.

# Notebook 5: Evaluation
This notebook introduces the LangChain evaluation platform and demonstrates how to evaluate the QnA system using the platform. It provides examples of setting up the evaluation and interpreting the results.LangChain provides tools for evaluating language model applications. It allows for manual and automated evaluation of language model responses against a set of examples or criteria. This helps in assessing the performance and accuracy of language model applications.

# Notebook 6: Agents
LangChain introduces the concept of agents, which are entities that can perform tasks using language models and tools. Agents can be customized with specific tools and capabilities to handle different types of tasks, such as mathematical calculations, accessing external information, or processing user inputs.

Built-in LangChain tools: Shows how to use pre-built tools like llm-math and wikipedia with LangChain agents.
Wikipedia example: Demonstrates how to use a LangChain agent to query Wikipedia for information.
Python Agent: Illustrates how to create and use a Python agent for sorting a list of customers.
Define your own tool: Teaches how to define a custom tool for a LangChain agent, such as a tool that returns today's date.
